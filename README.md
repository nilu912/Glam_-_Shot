Final Year Project: Online Salon Management System

This project is an Online Salon Management System developed as part of my Bachelor's final year project. The system is designed to help salon owners and customers manage appointments, customer records, and staff scheduling efficiently. The project utilizes Django for the backend and ReactJS (class-based components) for the frontend.
Key Features Implemented:

    User Registration & Login: Customers can create accounts, log in, and manage their profiles.
    Appointment Scheduling: Customers can book appointments by selecting available time slots for different services.
    Salon Services Management: The admin can add, modify, and manage salon services.
    Staff Management: Admins can manage salon staff profiles and assign schedules.
    Admin Dashboard: A simple dashboard for salon administrators to manage users, services, and appointments.

Unfinished or Incomplete Features:

    Payment Gateway Integration: The payment gateway functionality was not implemented due to time constraints. The project does not currently support online payments.
    Frontend Design: The frontend is functional, but it needs design improvements to make the user interface more polished.

Technology Stack:

    Backend: Django (Python)
    Frontend: ReactJS (class-based components)
    Database: SQLite (or another database, based on your choice)

Learning & Development:

This project was entirely developed by me without formal training in Django or ReactJS. I learned both technologies through self-study by referring to Google, official React documentation, Django tutorials, and JavaScript notes. Despite lacking formal coursework, I was able to build this system by learning and applying the concepts on my own.


Future Improvements:

    Payment Gateway Integration: Implement a secure payment gateway for online payments.
    Enhanced Frontend Design: Improve the UI/UX for better user experience.
    Additional Features: Add features like user reviews, notifications, and a better admin panel.

Conclusion:

While the project isn't fully finished due to time constraints, it successfully demonstrates the core functionalities of an online salon management system. The frontend and backend are functional, and the project can be further improved and extended in the future.
